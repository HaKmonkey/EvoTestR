This code is a work in progress and is based on code written by [@willpearse](https://github.com/willpearse). The initial project came from code written for a project in his class taught at USU.

This is an attempt to simulate evolution on herbivores experiencing food limitations due to elevation.

Each herbivore has 20 base pairs.
Every 5 bases codes for one enzyme.
Yay... I hope this ends up working...
