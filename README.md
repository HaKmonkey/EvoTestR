This code is a work in progress and is based on code written by [@willpearse](https://github.com/willpearse). The initial project came from code written for a project in his class taught at USU.

This is an attempt to simulate evolution on herbivores experiencing food limitations due to elevation.

Each herbivore has 20 base pairs.
Every 5 bases codes for one enzyme.
Yay... I hope this ends up working...

- [ ] Change herbivore log file to a matrix that will contain herbivore data
- [ ] User can define rate of log files
- Matrix will be outputted as a log file
- [ ] Figure out a way to make bases inheritable when reproducing (making a new herbivore)
- [ ] Make a wrapper to launch different tests for the simulation

**POSSIBLE AREAS OF STUDY**
- [ ] Can study coexistence
- [ ] Can introduce linkage disequilibrium
- [ ] Studying mutations with large phenotypic effect
- Do they have large or small effects
- Excludes standing genetic variation
- Adaptation from new mutation
